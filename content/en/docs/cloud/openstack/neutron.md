Compute hosts should always have the appropriate NICs configured for promiscuous mode. -- because compute host may have multiple virtual nic

The switch maintains the mappings of MAC addresses to switch ports in a table called a forwarding table or forwarding information base (FIB)

VLANs to isolate the traffic of different projects, even if the projects happen to have instances running on the same compute host.

When a switchport is configured for a specific VLAN, it is called an access port. 

Trunking is used to connect between different switches

While NICs use MAC addresses to address network hosts, TCP/IP applications use IP addresses.
