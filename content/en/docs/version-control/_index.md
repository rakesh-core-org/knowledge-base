Version control is essential for managing code and projects. This is responsible for tracking changes and also to keep the code in remote repository.

## Types of version control

- Local version control
- Centralized version control (subversion)
- Distributed version control (Git)


## Basic Concepts in Version Control
`Repository`: A projectâ€™s main directory containing all files and history.

`Commit`: A saved state of the repository at a specific point in time.

`Branch`: A separate line of development, allowing isolated changes without affecting the main codebase.

`Merge`: Combining changes from one branch into another.

`Pull/Push`: Pull to update your local code with remote changes, and push to upload your local changes.
